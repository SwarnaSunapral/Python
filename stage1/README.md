PYTHON SAMPLES

''' We can print strings on pyhton 
- print("My name is swarna")
- print("My age is 21")
- output = My name is swarna
                     My age is 21
  
'''
- print("My name is swarna.", "My age is 21.")
- output = My name is swarna. My age is 21.

''' We can print numbers on python
- print(32)
- output = 32
  
'''

- print(32, 23, 45)
- output = 32 23 45
  
'''

- print(2*3)
- output = 6  (multiplication)
   
'''we can add, subtract, multiply etc...... in python

VARIABLES
---
A variable is a name given to a memory location in a program
                                  |
                           
Syntax  : var  = value                                         
Example : name = Swarna
          age  = 21 
              ( variable means it can vary from time to time. Today it is 21, next year it will be 22. So we can change accordingly on pyhton )

''' code 
name = "Swarna"
age = 21                ---------// here '=' is a assignmnet value. 21 is getting stored in age variable
                                    age1 = age ( here age will be stored in age1 i.e, 21 )
- print("My name is:", name)      
- print("My age is:", age) 
- output = My name is : Swarna
- My age is : 21

Rules for Identifiers
---
1. Identifiers can be the combination of 
                                  . a - z
                                  . A - Z
                                  . 0 - 9
                                  . _ ( underscore )
2. Identifier cannot start with digit.
                variable1 is valid
                1variable is not valid
3. We cannot use specific symbols like $,%,@ etc 
4. Identifiers can be of any length.

'''Variable name should be simple, short, and meaningful

DATA TYPES
---
- print(type(name))
- output = <class 'str'>
1. Intergers - +ve, -ve, 0
2. String - "Swarna" 'Swarna' '''Swarna'''
