FIRST PROGRAM
---

. print(" Hello World ")   // print is a Function

CHARACTER SET

. digits           - 0-9

. symbols          - +, _, *, etc...   // Whatever present on keyboard we can use them

. whitespace       - blank space, tab 

. other characters - ASCII and Unicode Characters as part of data or literals

PYTHON SAMPLES
---

''' We can print strings on pyhton 
- print("My name is swarna")
- print("My age is 21")
- output = My name is swarna
                     My age is 21
  
'''
- print("My name is swarna.", "My age is 21.")
- output = My name is swarna. My age is 21.

''' We can print numbers on python
- print(32)
- output = 32
  
'''

- print(32, 23, 45)
- output = 32 23 45
  
'''

- print(2*3)
- output = 6  (multiplication)
   
'''we can add, subtract, multiply etc...... in python

VARIABLES
---
A variable is a name given to a memory location in a program
                                  |
                           
Syntax  : var  = value                                         
Example : name = Swarna
          age  = 21 
              ( variable means it can vary from time to time. Today it is 21, next year it will be 22. So we can change accordingly on pyhton )

''' code 
name = "Swarna"
age = 21                ---------// here '=' is a assignmnet value. 21 is getting stored in age variable
                                    age1 = age ( here age will be stored in age1 i.e, 21 )
- print("My name is:", name)      
- print("My age is:", age) 
- output = My name is : Swarna
- My age is : 21

Rules for Identifiers
---
1. Identifiers can be the combination of 
                                  . a - z
                                  . A - Z
                                  . 0 - 9
                                  . _ ( underscore )
2. Identifier cannot start with digit.
                variable1 is valid
                1variable is not valid
3. We cannot use specific symbols like $,%,@ etc 
4. Identifiers can be of any length.

'''Variable name should be simple, short, and meaningful

DATA TYPES
---
- print(type(name))
- output = <class 'str'>
1. Intergers - +ve, -ve, 0
2. String - "Swarna" 'Swarna' '''Swarna'''

4. Float - 1.1 2.33
5. Boolean - True | False
6. None

KEYWORDS
---
Keywords are reserved words in python

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e39e74e6-367a-41a9-872a-11f0d307612f)

. We cannot use these keywords as variables.
. Python is a case sensitive. e.g, None, True 

Print SUM
---
a = 2

b = 3

sum = a + b

print(sum)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c04a5be4-d592-4335-a373-fc0005d68e5d)

The same goes with all math calculations like subtraction, multiplication etc....

Comments in Python
---
'#' - For a single line comment

''' - For multi line comment

you can comment out using keyboard also - ( ctrl + / )

Types of Operators
---
An operator is a symbol that performs a certain operations between operands

| Operator Name | Operators |   
|:----------|:--------------------------|
| Arithmetic               |+, -, *, /, %, ** |
| Relational/Comparison    |==, !=, >, <, >=, <=|
| Assignment               |=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, **=|
| Logical                  |not, and, or|


Type Conversions
---
| Type Coversion | Type Casting |   
|:----------|:--------------------------|
| Automatically |Manually |
| a = 2         |a = "2"|
| b = 3.5       |b = 3.5|
| sum = a + b   |sum = int("2") + b|
|result = 5.5   |result = 5.5|  

Input in Python
---
input() statement is used to accept values from the user

. input()        - always results a string


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4851dc88-0cc5-49d0-9156-b48c5aff8980)


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c57ac08-4310-4b93-8573-5bd8d4891913)

Here it results an error because we have added data type int to the string i.e, input()

. int(input())   - int value

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bcbc54bc-a6cc-4fc0-af1c-51e26d482478)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/387c20f9-ee04-4ef7-9d3e-a5a9f4785509)


. float(input()) - float value
