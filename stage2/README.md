Strings
---
String is data type that stores a sequence of characters.

Different ways of quoting the string

. str1 = "This is a string."

. str2 = 'Swarnalatha Bai'

. str3 = '''string in triple quotes'''

Example:

'This is a apnacollege's tutorial'

Here starting from 'this and ending at tutorial' but in between there is college's. so this may create a problem. so we make use of double quotes.

Corrected Sentence

. "This is a apnacollege's tutorial"

- str4 = "Hi my name is swarna. 
- I am from Hyderabad"

Here this throws an error it is not allowed as word done in word docs. Instead we use 'Escape Sequence Characters'.
